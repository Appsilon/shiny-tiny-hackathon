# FAERS Public Dashboard

This Shiny application is a simulation of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), created using [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), `shiny`, `plotly`, and `reactable`.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Dynamic filters (gender, age group, year, seriousness, etc.)
- Multiple summary views (by gender, age, type, reporter, region...)
- Drilldown by drug
- Value boxes, stacked bar plot, and dynamic table

## ðŸ§  AI Tools Used

This project was built with the assistance of **ChatGPT** (March 2025 version), used to:
- Generate R code for simulating the FAERS dataset
- Design reactive UI components and logic in flexdashboard
- Create clean data visualizations with `plotly` and `reactable`
- Assist with dynamic layout and Shiny reactivity

The model provided real-time help with debugging, styling, and modularization of the app.

## âœ… How to run

Open `app.Rmd` and click **Run Document** or use the `Run App` button in RStudio.
