    This page displays the report counts based on the occupation of the Reporter, the person who submitted the report to FDA or the person who submitted the report to the manufacturer (who then sent the report to FDA). Physicians and pharmacists are the Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) who submit reports to FDA most frequently. Additional HCPs include nurses, dentists and other medical personnel. Reporters may also be classified as "Consumer", "Other" for all other Reporters who are not documented as Healthcare Professionals or Consumers, and "Not Specified" where the occupation of the Reporter was not provided.
