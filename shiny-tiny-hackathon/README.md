# Appsilon’s Tiny Shiny Hackathon: Build, Compete, and Win!

We are excited to invite you to the Appsilon Tiny Shiny Hackathon, a four-hour online challenge where developers can showcase their creativity and technical skills by building applications that combine Shiny and AI.

Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting with Shiny, this is a great opportunity to push your limits, learn from others, and gain recognition in the Shiny community.
