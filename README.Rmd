FAERS Public Dashboard

This Shiny application creates a public dashboard for exploring the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data. The dashboard provides key summary metrics, data visualizations, and interactive tables to help users analyze adverse event reports.

Overview

The FAERS Public Dashboard includes:

Custom Header and Navigation: A header with a title and logo, along with a navigation bar featuring links for Home, Disclaimer, Report a Problem, FAQ, and Site Feedback. The header and navbar styling are implemented using custom CSS.

Value Boxes: Summary boxes that display the total number of reports, serious reports (excluding deaths), and death reports.

Interactive Controls: Dropdowns and action buttons to filter data by report type and time period (all years or last 10 years).

Data Table: An interactive table (powered by the DT package) summarizing report details by year and report type.

Plotly Visualization: A stacked bar chart showing trends of adverse event reports over time by report type.

Modals: Pop-up dialogs for the Disclaimer, FAQ, Report a Problem, and Feedback sections.

Downloadable Policy: A downloadable Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (dummy PDF) available through a link in the footer.

Dependencies

The application uses several R packages:

shiny: For building interactive web applications.

bslib: For Bootstrap theming and styling.

fontawesome: For icons.

DT: For interactive data tables.

plotly: For interactive charts.

readr: For reading CSV data.

dplyr: For data manipulation.

Install these packages using:

install.packages(c("shiny", "bslib", "fontawesome", "DT", "plotly", "readr", "dplyr"))

Installation & Setup

Clone or Download the Repository:Ensure that all the required files (app.R, data.csv, dummy_Vulnerability_Disclosure_Policy.pdf, and www/logo.png) are in the project folder.

Place Files in the Correct Directories:

The CSV data file (data.csv) should be in the same directory as app.R.

The logo image should be placed in the www folder.

The PDF file should be located at the root or specified path as in the code.

Running the Application

Open the project in RStudio or any R environment and run the following command:

shiny::runApp()

This will start the Shiny application in your default web browser. You can then interact with the dashboard, filter the data, and view the visualizations.

Code Details

UI Definition:The UI is defined using page_fluid and includes custom CSS (inserted via tags$head(tags$style(...))) for styling the header, navigation bar, value boxes, controls, data table, and plot.

Server Logic:The server function handles:

Data reading and filtering based on user inputs.

Reactive values for updating the data set.

Rendering of value boxes, data table, and Plotly chart.

Event handling for modal pop-ups (Disclaimer, FAQ, Report a Problem, Feedback) and file download for the Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.

Interactivity:The dashboard allows users to:

Toggle between all data and data from the last 10 years.

Filter the data table by year and report type using custom search inputs.

View additional information via modals.

Customization

To modify or extend the dashboard:

UI Styling:Update the CSS within the tags$style(HTML("...")) block to change colors, fonts, or layout.

Data Handling:Adjust the reactive data processing in the server function to accommodate additional filtering or data aggregation logic.

Visualization:Customize the Plotly chart by modifying the plot_ly call in the renderPlotly function.

Disclaimer

The dashboard is for informational and educational purposes only. The data comes from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and is based on voluntary reports. The presence of a report does not imply causality or safety conclusions. Users should consult professional advice when evaluating drug safety.
