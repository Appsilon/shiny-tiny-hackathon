# Shiny Application - README

[CHECK THE APP HERE!](https://matcord.shinyapps.io/shiny_hackathon/)

## Overview

This Shiny application provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing and exploring data from an Excel file (`data.xlsx`). It includes structured UI components such as navigation bars, interactive cards, a data table, and a bar plot. The app uses the `highcharter` package for dynamic charting, along with `DT` for an interactive data table.

## Features

-   **Top Navigation Bar:** Displays the app title and logo.
-   **Secondary Navigation Bar:** Contains interactive menu options.
-   **Icon Cards:** Provide quick statistical insights.
-   **Controls Section:** Includes selection inputs and buttons for filtering data.
-   **Main Panel:** Displays a data table and a bar plot side by side.
-   **Bottom Panel:** Shows additional information and links.
-   **Modern UI Design:** Uses Google Fonts (`Poppins`) for a clean look.

## Dependencies

The app requires the following R packages:

``` r
install.packages(c("shiny", "highcharter", "dplyr", "DT", "readxl"))
```

Additionally, an external script (`aux_functions.R`) is sourced for helper functions.

## Data Requirements

The application reads data from `data.xlsx`, which should be formatted correctly to ensure smooth functionality.

## File Structure

```         
shiny_app/
│-- app.R              # Main Shiny app script
│-- aux_functions.R    # External helper functions
│-- data.xlsx          # Data file
```

## Usage

To run the application, execute:

``` r
shiny::runApp("path/to/shiny_app")
```

## UI Structure

The UI is structured using CSS and HTML to ensure a modern and responsive design: - **`.top-nav`**: Fixed height, blue background, contains app title and logo. - **`.secondary-nav`**: Contains navigation links. - **`.icon-cards`**: Displays key metrics. - **`.controls`**: Dropdown and buttons for user interaction. - **`.main-panel`**: Contains the data table and bar plot, flexibly sized. - **`.bottom-panel`**: Footer with additional links.

## Styling

Custom styles are defined in the `tags$head(tags$style(HTML(...)))` section to maintain a modern UI. Overflow handling ensures that the layout remains clean and scroll-free where applicable.

## Future Improvements

-   Add more interactivity (e.g., tooltips, additional filters).
-   Enhance visualizations with more chart types.
-   Optimize performance for large datasets.
